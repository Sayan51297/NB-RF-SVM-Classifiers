# NB-RF-SVM-Classifiers
It is a project given from college for 6th semester by the Data Science and Data Analytics Lab
This is a very simple approach to learn how these classifiers work using the scikit-learn package.
Occupancy Detection is the motive here.
The dataset is available at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html
